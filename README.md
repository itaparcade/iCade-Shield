iCade-Shield
===========

iCade-Shield is an Arduino-compatible Controller Module for the iCade Core and iCade Cabinet Arcade Controller Sticks

Play all kinds of video games using the iCade-Shield to bring back that Arcade Stick experience while programming in the Arduino language.  The original bluetooth controller board in both the iCade Core and iCade Cabinet can be replaced with the iCade-Shield so these controllers can natively work with the [OUYA](https://www.ouya.tv/) (indie microconsole for game developers), PC, Mac, and Android tablets.  An example sketch is currently available for the Teensy 2.0 version of the iCade-Shield USB to create a multi-funcional arcade stick (mouse, keyboard, and gamepad emulation).  You can reprogram the iCade-Shield using the Arduino IDE for custom keyboard, mouse, and joystick moves for any type of game.  Get more than one iCade-Shield to create a multiplayer arcade experience on the OUYA, PC, or Mac.  Works great with party games like [Tower Fall](http://www.towerfall-game.com/) and Bomb squad for great arcade stick party fun.  Create your own arcade stick game experience with this controller module.
