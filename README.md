Cade-Shield
===========

Cade-Shield is an Arduino-compatible Controller Module for the iCade Core and iCade Cabinet Arcade Controller Sticks

Play all kinds of video games using the Cade-Shield.  The original bluetooth controller board in both the iCade Core and iCade Cabinet can be replaced with the Cade-Shield to work with the [OUYA](https://www.ouya.tv/) (indie microconsole for game developers), PC, Mac, and Android tablets.  Code is currently available for the Teensy 2.0 version of the Cade-Shield USB.  You can reprogram the Cade-Shield using the Arduino IDE for custom keyboard, mouse, and joystick moves.  Get more than one Cade-Shield to create a multiplayer arcade experience on the OUYA or PC.  Works great with party games like Tower Fall and Bomb squad for great party fun.  Create your own arcade game experience system with this controller module.

Updates coming soon on how to create all times of games with the Cade-Shield.
